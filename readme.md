> Linting for your laravel project.

[![psr-2](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-PSR_2-blue.svg)](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

A laravel linter based on the [tlint](https://github.com/tighten/tlint) package from the folks over at Tighten.


## Installation

Install the package as a dev dependency:

```bash
composer require s360digital/laravel-linter --dev
```

Create a config, at the root of your repository, with the following contents:

```json
{
  "preset": "S360Digital\\LaravelLinter\\Presets\\S360DigitalPreset",
  "excluded": [
    "tests/",
    "database/"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Run the linter with all linters in the preset:

```bash
./vendor/bin/tlint
```

Run the linter against a single file or directory:

```bash
./vendor/bin/tlint lint app/Http/Controllers/PageController.php
./vendor/bin/tlint lint app
```

Lint the project with a single linter:

```bash
./vendor/bin/tlint --only="NoCompact"
```

## Configuration

The `tlint.json` config supports three different config keys.

### Preset

The "preset" defines which preset that should be used for linting the project. A preset is basicly just a set of linters, or rules, that the project should adhere to.

### Excluded

"excluded" is an array of paths that should be excluded from the linting process.

### Disabled

The "disabled" key can be used to disable a set of linters from being ran in your project.

```json
{
  "preset": "S360Digital\\LaravelLinter\\Presets\\S360DigitalPreset",
  "disabled": [
      "NoCompact",
      "UseConfigOverEnv"
  ],
  "excluded": [
    "tests/",
    "database/"
  ]
}
```
